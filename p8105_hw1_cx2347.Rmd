```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)

data("early_january_weather")
```

## Problem 1

Important variables in the dataset inlude `r variable.names(early_january_weather)`.
The dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.
The mean temperature is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp),2)`.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+geom_point()
ggsave("point plot.pdf", height=4, width=6)
```
